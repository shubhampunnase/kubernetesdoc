By default we can create 110 pod in one #node it can be anything 
we can incress or decress the pod size in any node 

remove taint form master {not naccary} if you have only 2 nodes 1 master and 1 worker then do this
#kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-

#kubectl describe node master 
you can see in pod will create 110 pods in deatils
#kubectl describe node worker

#for change limit 
# cd /var/lib/kubelet/
#vim config.yaml
search for maxPods 57line 72%
incress limit as mush you want 
maxPods: 1000000
# systemctl restart kubelet.service
node will be down form few min
#kubectl get nodes
#kubectl describe node worker

If you want to any node go in to that server and chnge the same it will reflect
